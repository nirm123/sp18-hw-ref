Homework 4 - Linked Lists

To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.

class Node(object):

    Class for linked list node.

def list_length(head):
    """
    Given a linked list, returns the length ofthe linked list.
    Suppose the existing linked list looks like this: 3 -> 5 -> 9 -> 6
    Then the length is 4.
    
    Input:
        head - the head Node of a linked list
    
    Returns:
        (int) The length of the linked list

def add_head(head, data):
    """
    Prepends a new Node to a linked list. You are given the head
    of the linked list and the data for the new Node.

    Example:
    Suppose the existing linked list looks like this: 3 -> 5 -> 9 -> 6
    In this case, head is a Node with head.data = 3. If the data argument
    is 10, then the resulting linked list should look like this:
    10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 9 -> 6

    Input:
        head - the head Node of a linked list
        data - the data element you'll need to add to the list

    Returns:
        (Node) the head of the new linked list that includes 'data'

def add_tail(head, data):
    """
    Appends a new Node to a linked list. You are given the head of
    the linked list and the data for the new Node.

    Example:
    Suppose the existing linked list looks like this: 7 -> 8 -> 2
    In this case, head is a Node with head.data = 7. If the data argument
    is 4, then the resulting linked list should look like this:

def remove_position(head, position):
    """
    Given the head of a linked list, removes the element of the 
    specified position. If the position is greater than the length
    of the linked list, do not remove anything.

    Input:
        head - the head of the linked list.
        position - the position at which to remove an element.

        the head of the linked list.

def find_cycle(head):
    """
    Given the head of a linked list, determines whether or not there
    is a cycle in the linked list.
    
    Ex. suppose we have a linked list 3 -> 4 -> 7, and the last node points
    back to the node labeled 4. Then this linked list has a cycle.
    
    Input:
        head - the head of the linked list.
    
    Output:
        (bool) whether or not there is a cycle in the linked list.
